      "text": "With its one-sided, semicircular, filamentary gas structure, SH2-188 is a weak and unusual planetary nebula in the Cassiopeia Constellation. It  represents one of the most extreme examples of interstellar medium  contact, or how planetary nebulas interact with space. It is a good  candidate for examining ISM effects because of its large angular  dimension (in comparison to many oother such nebulae) and apparent high  proper motion. The central star of Sh2-188 is an evolved entity that has shed most of its material and is on the verge of transitioning into the white dwarf phase. Based on its age and structure, it is generally  thought to be an old planetary nebula. It is located at a distance of  around 850 light-years, close to Ruchbach Star and was photographed for  the first time in 1965 by Gaze V.F. and Shain G.A."
